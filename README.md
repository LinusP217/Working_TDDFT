> Density functional theory is one of the greatest free lunches ever. It‚Äôs a mysterious way to bypass solving the Schr√∂dinger equation directly, making it relatively inexpensive to solve electronic structure problems, but requiring an uncontrolled approximation.

## ü™ü Overview

This repository contains learning material on time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT)  accesible through the Google Colaboratory (Colab). TDDFT is a widely used quantum chemistry method, but, like its ground-state counterpart, is oftentimes a black box method to the users of commerical software packages. we present here a collection of Colab tutorials addressing what is the most popular method for describing electronic excited states


Building on our previous work with pedagogic content on ground-state density functional theory (DFT), , namely time-dependent (TD)-DFT. Foundational concepts like the Runge-Gross theorem to more practical considerations relating to keywords used in commercial TD-DFT software are explored with interactive visualizations. Our approach relies on a simplified particle-in-a-box model system that allows for simplified integrals and matrix operations, yet preserves the fundamental essence of TD-DFT. Some knowledge of ground state DFT is assumed. Feel free to explore the content through the links below.

This is a project in development by the [Zuehlsdorff Group](https://timzuehlsdorff.com/) at Oregon State University üå≥.
