## ü™ü Overview

The Google Colaboratory (Colab) represents a highly accessible, scalable, and reproducible computational environment for researchers and educators alike. A substantial, and growing, body of Colab tutorials now exist for advanced topics in machine learning, molecular dynamics, electronic structure, and more. Building on our previous work with pedagogic content on ground-state density functional theory (DFT), we present here a collection of Colab tutorials addressing what is the most popular method for describing electronic excited states, namely time-dependent (TD) DFT. Foundational concepts like the Runge-Gross theorem to more practical considerations relating to keywords used in commercial TD-DFT software are explored with interactive visualizations. Our approach relies on a simplified particle-in-a-box model system that allows for simplified integrals and matrix operations, yet preserves the fundamental essence of TD-DFT. Developed by the [Zuehlsdorff Group](https://timzuehlsdorff.com/) at Oregon State University üå≥.
