> Density functional theory is one of the greatest free lunches ever. It‚Äôs a mysterious way to bypass solving the Schr√∂dinger equation directly, making it relatively inexpensive to solve electronic structure problems, but requiring an uncontrolled approximation.

## ü™ü Overview

This repository contains learning material on time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT)  accessible through the Google Colaboratory (Colab). TDDFT is a widely used method in quantum chemistry, but, like its ground state counterpart, is often a black box to the users of commercial software packages, e.g., VASP and Gaussian. This work helps to fix that. Intended for both researchers and students who want to develop a deeper understanding, we present a collection of Colab tutorials that progressively explains the fundamental concepts, from the Runge-Gross theorem to XC kernels to Casida's equation. Our approach relies on a one-dimensional particle-in-a-box model system that&mdash;in contrast to the complexity present in plane-wave and molecular codes&mdash;allows for simplified integrals and matrix operations. Basic knowledge of quantum mechanics and ground state DFT is assumed throughout. Feel free to explore the content through the links below.

This is a project in active development by the [Zuehlsdorff Group](https://timzuehlsdorff.com/) at Oregon State University üå≥ and is an extension of previous efforts with [pedagogic DFT content](https://github.com/tjz21/DFT_PIB_Code).
